Methodology
Data Preparation: This initial step involves data loading, where the sales dataset is imported, followed by data cleaning to handle missing values, standardize formats, and ensure the dataset is ready for analysis2.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): During this phase, various analytical techniques and visualizations (using libraries such as Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn) are employed to detect patterns and convey insights. Key metrics like sales amounts, transaction counts, and popular product categories are identified through visual representation6.

Customer Segmentation: The project segments customers based on demographic factors and identifies their purchasing behaviors, helping businesses tailor their strategies for different audiences accordingly2 and 7.

Insights and Recommendations: The culmination of this analysis yields insights that help businesses enhance their marketing strategies, optimize product availability, and maximize sales during critical periods like Diwali. Companies can refine inventory management based on the findings regarding popular products and peak purchasing times5.

Tools and Technologies
The project leverages various programming tools and libraries essential for data analysis:

Python: The core programming language utilized for executing data analysis tasks8.
Pandas: Used for data manipulation and cleaning, ensuring the dataset is tidy and ready for analysis.
Matplotlib & Seaborn: These libraries facilitate data visualization, allowing stakeholders to easily interpret complex datasets through graphs and charts6.
